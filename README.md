This bot will tweet once every 24 hours and report the highest and lowest prices of Bitcoin.
This bot will scrape data from a Bitcoin price reporting website and store it in a variable.
It will then uses Twitter API to report those prices on Twitter. It choses random Bitcoin pictures that
I have provided it. I have scheduled the program to run once in 24hours using the schedule and time library.
You might have to run the program continoulsy to get expected output or upload the code in a cloud 
platform like AWS or Heroku.
